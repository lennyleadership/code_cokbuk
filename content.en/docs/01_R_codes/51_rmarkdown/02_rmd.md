# embed a youtube video

embed one youtube video in rmarkdown:

Option #1:
```
<div class = "container">
  <div class = "image">
<figure>
[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/BRDApYgvDqQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRDApYgvDqQ)
<br><br>
Video #1: Laboratory Rules by AsapScience
</figure>
</div>
  <div class = "text">Laboratory Safety</div>
</div>
```
Option #2: use data-external= "1", instead of frameborder="0".  It works for one youtube video and a series of videos.
```
<div class = "container">
  <div class = "image">
<figure>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MEIXRLcC6RA" title="General Lab Safety" data-external= "1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Video #4: General Lab Safety
</figure>
  </div>
  <div class = "text"><p>laboratory Safety</p></div>
</div>

# html whitespace
The New Line character â€“ also known as the "carriage return". The HTML code for newline character is: &#13;
The Tab Character, which is what you get when you press the tab button in a text field. The HTML code for Tab Character is: &#09;

For example, let's say you want to put two spaces after a sentence, but something else in the website rendering engine is automatically removing one of the spaces. You may be able to type &#20;&#20; to add two spaces.

There are four common widths for space characters:

Standard-width space. This is also called "non-line breaking space" because it will not cause a line break (AKA carriage return).
Em space. This is called "Em" because it's as wide as the letter M is in whichever typeface you're using. (If you've heard the term em-dash, this is a dash as wide as the letter M.)
En space. This is called "En" because it's as wide as the letter n is in your typeface.
And finally, there's "Thin space", which is the thinnest of all spaces.
